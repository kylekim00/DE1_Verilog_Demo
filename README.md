# Verilog_Demo
This contains verilog Demo on DE1 Board calculating one number at a time and memorizing the number to add with the next number input. Conclude hand-made Binary to Decimal module

Adder controls all the adding process. BintoDec module turns Binary into Decimal. and Sevenseg turns Decimal to output appropriate for 7seg display.

This demo was demonstrated by DE1 FPGA board. there are ten switch inputs, three button inputs, and six 7-seg display.
